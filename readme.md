## User Types and Registration

The system supports three user types:
- **Manager**: Administrators who manage the system
- **Teacher**: Can create and organize events
- **Student**: Can participate in events and provide reviews

New user accounts require confirmation by a manager before they can access the system.

## Project Structure

- **Core**: Main Django project configuration
- **User**: User management and authentication
- **Event**: Event creation, management, and participation
- **Review**: Rating and commenting system for events
- **Badge**: Achievement system for user activities
- **Leaderboard**: Rankings based on participation and organization
- **Notification**: User notification system

## Development Workflow

1. Run migrations when changing models:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Create new app (if needed):
   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp new_app_name
   ```
   Don't forget to add the new app to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.

3. Collect static files for production:
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

## Media File Handling

The system supports profile images and other media uploads with size limits configured in settings.py:

```python
MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024  # 5MB
```

## Security Notes

For production deployment:
1. Change `DEBUG = False` in settings.py
2. Generate a new `SECRET_KEY`
3. Set appropriate `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
4. Configure a production database (PostgreSQL recommended)
5. Set up proper static and media file serving
